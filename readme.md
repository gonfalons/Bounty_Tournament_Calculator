# Why?
    Poker tournaments are more complicated than cash games.
    In a cash game, $1 on the table is $1. In poker tournaments, this is not the case.

    Game theory has come up with models to analyze tournament play,
    [Independent Chip Modeling](https://www.icmpoker.com/en/blog/poker-icm-101-what-is-icm-poker/ "ICM")but no player is perfect in real time.`

    Poker is a game of incomplete information. For a serious player trying to analyze the game in real time, the player must (rapidly) process a huge amount of factors, decide which ones are more important at that moment, consider basic poker theory... __(such as pot odds, how much is in the pot, what are my odds of winning, how likely is my draw to improve to the best hand, what percentage of hands is my opponent playing here, are we close to payouts, justifying a very defensive strategy, or in the same situation, with a large amount of chips, perhaps a very aggressive one?)__

    In short, there is too much going on at once for any person to take into account all (useful) variables. </p>

# The goal of the app is to simplify the game.
    * Bounty tournaments offer yet another variable, an immediate cash reward for knocking any player out of the tournament.
    * There are variable sub-categories of bounty tournaments, further complicating the strategy
    * Real, serious influence on game strategy.
        I once faced an opponents all-in raise where I had more chips (I would win the knockout, if my hand wins.) in an $8 buy-in tournament.
        My at-risk opponent's displayed bounty was well over $1,000), but if I lost the hand, I would be left with 'a chip and a chair'.

        This $1,000 bounty was either worth $250, $500, or $750 in cash.
            This is confusing and in a high-stakes situation, having this bounty shown to me as:
            **An effective chip amount** would have allowed me to make a more informed choice. No time to run conversions.

# In short:
    to use poker theory to simplify bounty tournaments by accurately, in real time, converting bounties to tournament poker chip values.

    Allowing the player to:
        instantly access simplified game variables,
        see an 'effective chip stack', 'effective pot size' including bounties,
        make better choices.
